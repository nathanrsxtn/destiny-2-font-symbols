# Destiny 2 Font Symbols
The font icons on this site were taken from the fonts folder in the Destiny 2 files, and button styles were taken from the bungie website.
The scanner folder contains a short script to search a font for characters in a certain range (Chrome Only).
The site can be accessed from [this link](https://nathanrsxtn.github.io/Destiny-2-Font-Symbols/) (works best in the Steam overlay).
Clicking on symbols **copies** the symbol. You will have to use the usual keyboard shortcut to paste it into your username or in-game chat (the symbols will only show up in-game).
